# Retail Data

The **retail sales data of a store** typically shows the price per unit - PPU, volume/quantity of sales, and profit earned across stores in cities of states. One can investigate the **demand curve** (price & quantity relationship) of a product/SKU across the states.

Demand curves can be used either for an individual consumer or for all consumers in a particular market (market demand curve).

The retail or ecommerce data is utilized to forecast volume (daily/weekly) of sales as well as to optimize revenue or profit margin wrt the price of product. This exercise is price optimization (pricing problem) wherein one maximizes either revenue or margin while optimizing the price which is subject to various factors such as competition, customer behavior, etc.

In econometrics, a log-log model is a regression model where both the dependent and independent variables are transformed using (natural) logarithms. This transformation allows for interpretation of coefficients as elasticities, representing the percentage change in the dependent variable for a 1% change in the independent variable.

One can use linear model (lm) plot (multiple relationships) or regression plot (single relationship) depending on the use-case to visualize the demand curve. However, a linear regression model hardly works for estimating price elasticity and optimizing price, due to the presence of several influential factors, and sometimes they're inter-dependent. 

**Price elasticity** is determined from the demand curve and is defined as the **change in quantity** or demand of product with **unit change in price** of the product.

**The following Nature paper (2020) details about Bayesian Modeling.** It outlines WAMBS - 'When to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics' while discussing prior distribution types that can be fed into the model, variable selection methods, MCMC & non-MCMC based sampling to arrive at posterior distributions, and commonly used Bayesian software (open-source) programs.
